# 🌸 **OvaAI – PCOS Detection System**

**OvaAI** is a sophisticated and user-centric system designed to facilitate the early detection of **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)**, a condition that affects many women worldwide. By leveraging cutting-edge machine learning models for both **image-based** and **symptom-based** analyses, OvaAI empowers users to gain valuable insights into their health.

The **frontend interface** offers a seamless experience, connecting users to the backend models that analyze:

- 🩻 **Ultrasound Images** for automated PCOS detection.
- 📋 **Symptom-Based Risk Scoring** based on self-reported health data.

> **Note:** The backend, including the trained ML models, is securely hosted to ensure data privacy and efficient performance.
